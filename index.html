  <h1>Entrepreneurship Canada</h1>
  
  <div>
    Our world today is filled with conflicting frames that dictate how we think, work, dream and 
    attempt to change things for the better; business versus charity, profit versus purpose,
    career versus calling.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    A generation of women and youth is emerging that is not only questioning those frames,
    but also redrawing them, 
    and unifying under new models of entrepreneurship. 
  </div>
  
  <div>
    On June 15th Canadian Entrepreneurship Commission 
    will launch a bold new program to help shape Canada 
    into global powerhouse for these new models of 21st century entrepreneurship.
